      C:\Users\iSlipperyy> whoami  
I'm Elijah Ali ‚Äî also known as <strong>iSlipperyy</strong>, a red teamer in training with a deep passion for offensive security and digital infrastructure.
Cybersecurity wasn‚Äôt always my focus ‚Äî but once I saw the world behind the screen, I never looked back. What started as curiosity quickly became obsession. I now spend my time building and attacking networks, documenting every step of the grind, and constantly leveling up.
To me, networking is the root of everything. Without networks, there‚Äôs nothing to exploit. Nothing to defend. No signal to trace. That‚Äôs why I dove deep ‚Äî studying protocols, building lab environments, and simulating real-world network traffic using open-source tools like pfSense, Zebra routers, and even physical Cisco gear.
I build because I love it. I break because I must understand it. I document it all to share my journey.
My goal? To become the Isaac Newton of cybersecurity and networking ‚Äî discovering truths, building systems, and rewriting the rules of how we think about digital security.
This is just the beginning. The deeper I go, the more I realize: this isn't just tech. It's my purpose.
